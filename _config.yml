  I am currently a Phd student working in the fields of high frequency predictive modeling of electrical system. This cover Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and global electrical system modeling and optimization.
  Before this I was a research engineer student working Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of electrical system. I had had various work experience in very different companies: small companies for a more diverse and operational activity and flexible environements, big companies with great amount of know-how in aeronautics with numerical simulation and various level of computationnal requirements. 
  This broad background always gives me ideas for new projects that I love to share with my close friends and familly on github.
  Feel free to contact me over one of my projects or one of my publications, I'll be happy to discuss it!

      When I am not working I like :
      - Brewing all kinds of beers in all kind of format
      - Tinkering with Raspberry pis, Arduinos, 3D printing and CNC machining.
      - Biking.
      - Repairing broken electronics and bikes.
